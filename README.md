English and Polish translator. GNU/Linux user.

I like people and I care about free, ethical and nondiscriminating software.
Pleased to provide free translation for activists and FOSS projects.
If you're interested in software freedom or need help, I would love to be of assistance.
Always happy to learn and talk about a wide range of important and unimportant topics.
